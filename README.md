### Description

Watch 28 frames of animated cow walk all over your desktop and windows, munch on the grass and moo occasionally. I was inspired by a web site I found whilst researching another project. I downloaded the cow animation and thought I might as well have some fun with it. The code is a little messy because I just threw it together on a lazy Saturday night.
